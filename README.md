not half baked! almost well done. ;)

## A small, self hosted, medium like python blogging toolset.

Medium *like* means that it mimics the style, UX, usabilty like inline editing ... using the great stuff out there like mediumish theme from wowthemes. The wonderful medium-editor.js which gives you the capability to edit the articles inline. The backend is served by PythonOnWheels. The superb tinyDB is used as a small simple, local full python DB.

## Simple usage:

### clone the repo 
```git clone https://github.com/pythononwheels/medium.py.git medium```

### Install the requirements:

pip install - r requirements.txt

### start the server
python server.py

### Thats it!
Everything else works online just as you know it from medium.
